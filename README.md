# Python BDI Experiments

This repository contains some code implementing a simple BDI framework in Python, with a built-in example scenario. The sample scenario will not be able to run to completion without the corresponding ROS packages and ROS Bridge software, which is not published here.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/ronsm/Python-BDI-Experiments.git```
2. Navigate into the downloaded repository on the command line
3. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to ensure dependencies are satisfied
4. Run ```python super.py``` to start the program

This assumes that your default Python version is Python 3. If your default is Python 2, you should use ```pip3``` and ```python3``` in the above commands.
